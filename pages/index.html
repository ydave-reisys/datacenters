<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_19_1.pdf" target="_blank">The Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI)</a> established in OMB Memorandum M-16-19 supercedes the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) and fulfills the data center requirements of the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA).</p>


<p>The DCOI requires agencies to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Develop and report on their data center strategies;</li>
    <li>Transition to more efficient infrastructure, such as cloud services and inter-agency shared services;</li>
    <li>Leverage technology advancements to optimize infrastructure; and</li>
    <li>Provide quality services for the public good.</li>
</ul>

<p>This site strives to compile helpful links and information resources for both Federal agencies and the public regarding implementation of the DCOI.</p>
