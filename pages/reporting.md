## Reporting

### Compliance Measurement

Data will be collected quarterly on an agency-by-agency basis through the OMB OFCIO IDC, as follows:

1. Agencies must continue to maintain complete inventories of all data center facilities, closure/consolidation plans, and properties of each facility owned, operated, or maintained by or on behalf of the agency.
2. Agencies must include progress toward meeting all optimization metric target values.<sup id="fnr31"><a href="#fn31">31</a></sup>
3. Agencies must evaluate the costs of operating and maintaining current facilities and develop year-by-year targets for cost savings and cost avoidance due to consolidation and optimization for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. Agencies shall report all realized cost savings and cost avoidance under the DCOI.

### Annual Strategic Plan

In accordance with FITARA,<sup id="fnr32"><a href="#fn32">32</a></sup> beginning in fiscal year 2016, each agency head shall annually publish a Data Center Consolidation and Optimization Strategic Plan ("Strategic Plan") to define the agency's data center strategy for the subsequent three years.

This strategy must include (at minimum):

1. Planned and achieved performance levels for each optimization metric, by year;
2. Planned and achieved closures, by year;
3. An explanation for areas in which achieved optimization metrics and closures did not meet those planned in a previous Strategic Plan;
4. A description of the steps the agency is taking or will take to achieve its future planned performance levels and closure goals;
5. Year-by-year calculations of target and actual agency-wide spending and cost savings on data centers from FY2016-FY2018, including:
  - A description of any initial costs for data center consolidation and optimization; and
  - Life cycle cost savings and other improvements (including those beyond FY2018, if applicable);
6. Historical costs and cost savings and cost avoidances due to data center consolidation and optimization through FY2015; and
7. A statement from the agency CIO stating whether the agency has complied with all reporting requirements in this memorandum and the data center requirements of FITARA. If the agency has not complied with all reporting requirements, the agency must provide a statement describing the reasons for not complying.

Agencies are required to publish their Strategic Plans in a machine-readable JSON format at agency.gov/digitalstrategy under a section entitled, "Data Center Optimization Initiative Strategic Plans," within 60 days of the issuance of this memorandum.  OMB will provide instructions to agencies, including a schema, at management.cio.gov within 30 days of the issuance of this memorandum.

The DCOI Strategic Plan will replace existing FDCCI requirements for consolidation plans. Data center consolidation and optimization efforts will continue to be a part of PortfolioStat reviews.
