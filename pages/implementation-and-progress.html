<h3>Metric Target Values</h3>

<p>OMB will measure agency progress for this initiative using the following optimization, cost savings, and closure metrics and goals on a quarterly basis, by way of agencies' quarterly data center inventory submissions.</p>

<p>Optimization, cost-savings, and closure metrics and goals apply to all federally-owned data centers, except high-performance computing (HPC) nodes.</p>

<h3 id="goal-1-optimization">Goal 1: Optimization</h3>

<p>The following optimization metrics are listed in order of priority. Agencies shall achieve and maintain all listed target values by the end of fiscal year 2018:<sup id="fnr22"><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup></p>

<p>Only the Server Utilization &amp; Automated Monitoring optimization metric shall apply to non-tiered data centers.</p>

<h3 id="goal-2-cost-savings-and-avoidance">Goal 2: Cost Savings and Avoidance</h3>

<p>Agencies shall, by the end of fiscal year 2018, reduce government-wide annual costs attributable to physical data centers by at least 25%, relative to the fiscal year 2016 IT Infrastructure Spending data submitted to the Federal IT Dashboard. Agencies shall collectively achieve the following amounts of savings (combined cost savings and cost avoidance)<sup id="fnr28"><a href="#fn28">28</a></sup> in each of fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018:</p>
