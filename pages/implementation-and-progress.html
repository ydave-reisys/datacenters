<h3>Metric Target Values</h3>

<p>OMB will measure agency progress for this initiative using the following optimization, cost savings, and closure metrics and goals on a quarterly basis, by way of agencies quarterly data center inventory submissions. These optimization, cost-savings, and closure metrics and goals apply to all data centers at agency facilities.</p>

<p>Optimization, cost-savings, and closure metrics and goals apply to all federally-owned data centers, except high-performance computing (HPC) nodes.</p>

<h3 id="goal-1-optimization">Goal 1: Optimization</h3>

<p>The following optimization metrics are listed in order of priority. Agencies shall achieve and maintain all listed target values by the end of fiscal year 2018:</p>
